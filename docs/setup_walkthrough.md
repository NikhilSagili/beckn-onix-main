# Steps to setup a new Beckn network and conduct transactions on it

## Introduction

This document describes setting up of a [Beckn network](https://becknprotocol.io/) with Beckn-ONIX and conducting transactions in a couple of domains (retail and energy). The general flow will involve the following steps:

- [Setup the prerequisites](#overall-prerequisites)
- [Create a new network and install the registry](#create-a-new-network-and-install-the-registry)
- [Install a gateway for the network](#install-a-gateway-for-the-network)
- [Install a Beckn Adaptor for the BAP](#install-a-beckn-adaptor-for-the-bap)
- [Install a Beckn Adaptor for the BPP](#install-a-beckn-adaptor-for-the-bpp)
- [Change the status of the BAP and BPP on the registry as Subscribed](#change-the-status-of-the-bap-and-bpp-on-registry-to-subscribed)
- [Update BAP and BPP with the layer 2 configuration files for the domains we are interested in](#update-bap-and-bpp-with-the-layer-2-configuration-files-for-the-domains-we-are-interested-in)
- [Conduct successful transactions on the network](#conduct-successful-transactions-on-the-network)

For the sake of illustration, all the urls are shown as subdomains of becknprotocol.io. These will not be available for you to configure on your network. When you are installing on your network, replace them with your own domain name. For example when the instruction below says "https://onix-registry.becknprotocol.io", if you own a domain "example.org", then what you enter will be "https://onix-registry.example.org". Of course you can give a different subdomain than `onix-registry`. However you should be consistent in using the same URL wherever registry url is required.

Some of the outputs listed below might be different when you run the script for the first time. The output depends on whether the required docker containers are present in the machine or not.

Run the following two commands on all machines where the script is being run for the first time. Login to a new shell for the command to take effect and continue with the installation. Not doing so will result in docker permisssion error

```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Please refer to the [Beckn-ONIX User Guide](./user_guide.md) for detailed explanation of the below steps.

## Sample deployment diagram

The following diagram shows a conceptual view of a multi-node Bekn network that we will be setting up. The urls shown here are the same as those used in the examples.

![Typical deployment](./images/sample_deployment.png)

## Overall prerequisites

- Setup the following subdomains at the registrar. Refer to [registering or adding domain or subdomain section](./user_guide.md/#appendix-a---registering-or-adding-domain-or-subdomains)

  - https://onix-registry.becknprotocol.io - point to machine with registry
  - https://onix-gateway.becknprotocol.io - point to machine with gateway
  - https://onix-bap-client.becknprotocol.io - point to machine with BAP
  - https://onix-bap.becknprotocol.io - point to machine with BAP
  - https://onix-bpp-client.becknprotocol.io - point to machine with BPP
  - https://onix-bpp.becknprotocol.io - point to machine with BPP

- Configure the reverse proxy to have the right ssl certificate installed for all the addresses above. Refer to [configuring ssl certificates on in reverse proxy](./user_guide.md/#ssl-certificates-configured-in-reverse-proxy) for more details
- Configure the reverse proxy with proxy_pass to configure the following routes. Refer to [configuring reverse proxy using proxy_pass](./user_guide.md/#configuring-nginx-reverse-proxy-using-proxy-pass) for details.

  - https://onix-registry.becknprotocol.io to port 3030 on the machine
  - https://onix-gateway.becknprotocol.io to port 4030 on the machine
  - https://onix-bap-client.becknprotocol.io to port 5001 on the machine
  - https://onix-bap.becknprotocol.io to port 5002 on the machine
  - https://onix-bpp-client.becknprotocol.io to port 6001 on the machine
  - https://onix-bpp.becknprotocol.io to port 6002 on the machine

![Reverse Proxy Configuration Illustrated](./images/reverse_proxy_configuration.png)

- This guide assumes you have a marketplace or a headless store and want to set it up to work with the Beckn network. It is still useful for people who are developing the buyer side software and want to set it up with the network. In such cases a [sandbox](https://github.com/beckn/beckn-sandbox) might be required to mimic a marketplace or a headless shop.

## Create a new network and install the registry

- ssh into the virtual server that will hold the registry, clone the repo, change into the install folder and run the beckn-onix.sh script.

```
git clone https://github.com/beckn/beckn-onix.git
cd beckn-onix/install
./beckn-onix.sh
```

- In the prompt that comes up, choose setting up a new network.

```

## Change the status of the BAP and BPP on registry to Subscribed

The newly added BAP and BPP should be transitioned to the "SUBSCRIBED" state in the registry.

- Login to the newly installed registry (e.g. https://onix-registry.becknprotocol.io). The default username and password are root/root
- In the Admin menu, click Network Participant
- Click the pencil icon next to the onix-bap.becknprotocol.io
- Click on the Network Role tab
- Click on the pencil icon in the row of onix-bap.becknprotocol.io
- Change the status to SUBSCRIBED
- Click the Done button.

- In the Admin menu, click Network Participant
- Click the pencil icon next to the onix-bpp.becknprotocol.io
- Click on the Network Role tab
- Click on the pencil icon in the row of onix-bpp.becknprotocol.io
- Change the status to SUBSCRIBED
- Click the Done button.

## Update BAP and BPP with the layer 2 configuration files for the domains we are interested in

The installation so far has installed a core Beckn network with the registry, gateway, BAP and the BPP. We cannot perform tranasctions on it till we have a layer 2 config file installed for the domains we want to transact in.

- Login to the virtual server with the BAP
- Change into the beckn-onix/layer2 folder
- Run the download_layer_2_config_bap.sh file.
- Specify the path to the layer 2 config file for the domain of interest. For example, for retail, we have https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beckn/beckn-onix/main/layer2/samples/retail_1.1.0.yaml and for energy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beckn/beckn-onix/main/layer2/samples/uei_charging_1.1.0.yaml

- Login to the virtual server with the BPP
- Change into the beckn-onix/layer2 folder
- Run the download_layer_2_config_bpp.sh file.
- Specify the path to the layer 2 config file for the domain of interest. For example, for retail, we have https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beckn/beckn-onix/main/layer2/samples/retail_1.1.0.yaml and for energy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beckn/beckn-onix/main/layer2/samples/uei_charging_1.1.0.yaml

- Now with these layer 2 configs installed, we can conduct retail and energy transactions on the network.

## Conduct successful transactions on the network

- Load the collection available at `artifacts\ONIX Demo Collection.postman_collection.json` in this repo.
- Run the UEI >> Search request
- The request should succeed without any errors.
- Additional folders and tests will be addded to this collection.
